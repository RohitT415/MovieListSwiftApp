# Rohit Tallapragada: Standalone App Project
My standalone "list of stuff" project is based on Timeout's list of the best films of 2022 (https://www.timeout.com/film/the-best-films-of-2022-so-far). It allows you to view each film's title, Timeout's review/synopsis, and a notable still image from the movie. You can also mark a movie as watched or unwatched using a checkmark. These movies can be filtered using a "Watched Movies" toggle. TThe app icon was made using https://www.appicon.co and Timeout's official logo, and the film descriptions and movie images are from Timeout.

Cut Content:
I was originally planning for more additions to this project that I was ultimately unable to get working. I still left what remenants I had of these ideas in the final project.
- a profile tab that could have displayed your username and app settings
- two different pages for a "featured" page like the Landmarks tutorial, and the main page that I have currently
- a slideshow of images on a movie's tab, rather than just one image
- a genres filter based off each film's genre

I wasn't able to get these ideas working, so I had to give up on them. On future app projects, these are both things I want to figure out how implement since I wasn't able to in this one.
